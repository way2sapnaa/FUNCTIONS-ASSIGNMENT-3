Generator Functions: These are functions that use the yield keyword to return values one at a time.\n\t2. Generator Expressions: These are similar to list comprehensions but use parentheses () instead of square brackets [].\n\n----\n\n1. Generator Functions\nA generator function is defined like a normal function but contains one or more yield statements. When the function is called, it returns a generator object without executing the function. The function's code runs only when next() is called on the generator object.\n\nExample:\ndef my_generator():\n    yield 1\n    yield 2\n    yield 3\n\ngen = my_generator()  # Create generator object\nprint(next(gen))  # Output: 1\nprint(next(gen))  # Output: 2\nprint(next(gen))  # Output: 3\n\n----\n\n2. Generator Expressions\nGenerator expressions are a concise way to create generators. They are written similarly to list comprehensions but use parentheses.\n\nExample:\ngen_exp = (x**2 for x in range(5))  # Generator expression\nprint(next(gen_exp))  # Output: 0\nprint(next(gen_exp))  # Output: 1\nprint(next(gen_exp))  # Output: 4\n\n----\n\nKey Features of Generators:\n\t1. Lazy Evaluation: Values are generated only when requested, saving memory.\n\t2. State Retention: Generators maintain their state between calls, so they resume execution from where they left off.\n\t3. StopIteration: When the generator has no more values to yield, it raises a StopIteration exception.\n\n----\n\nAdvantages of Generators:\n\t* Memory Efficiency: They do not store the entire sequence in memory.\n\t* Infinite Sequences: Generators can represent infinite sequences, unlike lists.\n\t* Improved Performance: They are faster for large datasets as they avoid the overhead of creating and storing large data structures.\n\nGenerators are a powerful tool in Python for writing clean, efficient, and memory-friendly code.

      "source": "To explain the internal mechanism of the reduce function for summing the list [47, 11, 42, 13], let's break it down step by step:\n\nCode Example:\nfrom functools import reduce\n\nnumbers = [47, 11, 42, 13]\nresult = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers)\nprint(result)  # Output: 113\n\nInternal Mechanism:\nThe reduce function works by applying the provided function (in this case, a lambda function for addition) cumulatively to the elements of the list. Here's how it proceeds:\n\n\t1. Initialization:\n\n\n\t\t* The first two elements of the list are taken: 47 and 11.\n\t\t* The lambda function is applied: 47 + 11 = 58.\n\t2. First Iteration:\n\n\n\t\t* The result from the previous step (58) is combined with the next element in the list (42).\n\t\t* The lambda function is applied: 58 + 42 = 100.\n\t3. Second Iteration:\n\n\n\t\t* The result from the previous step (100) is combined with the next element in the list (13).\n\t\t* The lambda function is applied: 100 + 13 = 113.\n\t4. Final Result:\n\n\n\t\t* The final cumulative result is 113.\n\nStep-by-Step Breakdown:\n| Step | x   | y   | x + y | Result |\n|------|-----|-----|-------|--------|\n| 1    | 47  | 11  | 58    | 58     |\n| 2    | 58  | 42  | 100   | 100    |\n| 3    | 100 | 13  | 113   | 113    |\n\nFinal Output:\nThe sum of the list [47, 11, 42, 13] using reduce is 113.\n\nThis is how the internal mechanism of the reduce function works for the given sum operation.",
